### -  quantitative visualization ideas 
## I want to explore more about the gender feature. to show the huge gap between male and female artists based on the collections that MET chose to collect.

### How can it apply here? 

### What data set is interesting to explore quantitatively? 
## acquisition number for each year
## number of male and female artists
## thinking of create a new variable (the difference of number of artworks from male and female artists for each year)



### What story is interesting to tell?
## is the gap bewteen male and female artists enlarged or the gap is becoming continously smaller

### designed mockup of your visualization  Include a headline, and labels.

### Think of 2 questions you want to ask the Met people
## what do you think is the most representative features can represnet the huge gap between male and female artists
## Do you have a certain policy that try to boast female artists? since it seems to be a very topic recently
